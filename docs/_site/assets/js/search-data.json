This flow includes entry criteria for checking if the record is new and if certain fields are populated. Functionality: Executes conditional formulas and updates assignments, establishing initial data accuracy and preventing incomplete records from being saved. Activity Rules - Event After Save . Purpose: Triggers actions after an event record is saved, checking whether the event is new or updated to determine next steps. Functionality: Uses decision elements to conditionally execute subflows or tasks based on whether the saved event is a new record or an update, allowing for appropriate follow-up actions or notifications. Activity Rules - Event and Task After Save Subflow . Purpose: Supports the main “Event After Save” flow by executing additional tasks associated with saved events, particularly for complex workflows where additional follow-ups are required. Functionality: The subflow checks specific conditions related to the event’s status and executes relevant tasks or updates, providing layered task management within event-related workflows. Activity Rules - Start . Purpose: Serves as an initialization flow that prepares the system for executing subsequent activity rule jobs or processes. Functionality: Initiates the sequence of rule-based tasks, ensuring that the conditions and triggers are set for executing the Activity Rules System as designed. Activity Rules - Create Child Activity Records . Purpose: Generates child activity records based on certain criteria within the parent record, automating the creation of related tasks. Functionality: Checks entry criteria and conditionally creates child records, which helps to automate task generation and ensures that necessary follow-up actions are systematically added. Activity Rules - Create Activity Rule Jobs . Purpose: Sets up activity rule jobs based on triggers or predefined conditions, allowing structured management of jobs related to activity rules. Functionality: Ensures that tasks are created and queued within the system when certain conditions are met, organizing workflow steps based on specified rules. Activity Rules - Run Activity Rule Jobs . Purpose: Executes the jobs created by the “Create Activity Rule Jobs” flow, effectively carrying out scheduled or triggered tasks within the activity rules system. Functionality: Manages the execution of job tasks, ensuring that rules are applied to carry out necessary actions in a structured and timely manner. Activity Rules - Event On Delete . Purpose: Handles the deletion of events by triggering necessary actions or updates when an event is removed from the system. Functionality: Checks conditions related to the deleted event and performs clean-up actions or related updates, maintaining data integrity and ensuring that dependent records are updated accordingly.

Purpose: Collects any additional contacts or responsible parties not designated as primary, allowing these to be included in activity management. Activity Rules - EventRelations . Purpose: Manages relationships between events, linking related events together within a Matter for organized tracking. Activity Rules - Create Child Activity Records . Purpose: Automatically generates child activity records based on specific conditions, supporting structured task and event hierarchies. Activity Rules - Create Child Tasks-No SharedActivities . Purpose: Creates child tasks without using Salesforce’s Shared Activities feature, ensuring each task remains individually tracked. Activity Rules - Create Activity Rule Jobs . Purpose: Sets up specific jobs or tasks under activity rules, automating task generation based on conditions in the Matter. Activity Rules - Calculate Child Date . Purpose: Calculates dates for child activities, adjusting for business days or other parameters, ensuring tasks align with required timelines. Activity Rules - Get Assignment IDs .

Profiles play a fundamental role in this structure by defining baseline permissions for user groups, including what they can view or edit. However, modern practices prefer Permission Sets for augmenting user permissions without altering Profiles, offering greater flexibility and minimizing the need to create numerous custom Profiles. For group-level access control, User Groups are used to bundle users with shared permissions or data access. Sharing Rules further enhance data access by extending permissions beyond the defaults set by organization-wide sharing settings, making them vital for ensuring the right teams have access to necessary records without compromising data security.

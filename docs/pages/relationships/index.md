# Object Relationships

## Overview

This section provides comprehensive documentation of object relationships within the ReconMMS system. Understanding these relationships is crucial for effective system configuration, data management, and report creation.

## Core Object Groups

### Matter Management
- [Matter Relationships](matter-relationships)
  - Matter Contact
  - Matter Account
  - Matter Note
  - Related Matter
  - Work Group

### Investigation Management
- Investigation Relationships
  - Investigation Contact
  - Investigation Account
  - Evidence
  - Evidence Contact

### Activity Management
- Activity Rule Relationships
  - Activity Rule Assignment
  - Activity Rule Job
  - Child Activity

### Request Management
- Request Relationships
  - Matter
  - Investigation
  - Issues

## Common Relationship Patterns

### One-to-Many (Master-Detail)
- Parent objects control child record sharing and deletion
- Roll-up summaries available
- Examples:
  - Matter → Matter Contact
  - Investigation → Evidence
  - Activity Rule → Activity Rule Job

### Many-to-One (Lookup)
- More flexible relationships
- Optional relationships
- Examples:
  - Matter → Investigation
  - Request → Matter
  - Evidence → Investigation

### Junction Objects
- Many-to-Many relationships
- Tracking additional relationship data
- Examples:
  - Matter Contact (Contact-Matter relationship)
  - Investigation Account (Account-Investigation relationship)
  - Evidence Contact (Contact-Evidence relationship)

## Using This Section

Each relationship page includes:
1. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
2. Detailed field descriptions
3. Common use cases
4. Best practices
5. Implementation considerations

## Key Considerations

### Security and Sharing
- Master-detail relationships inherit sharing rules
- Lookup relationships require explicit sharing rules
- Field-level security implications

### Data Management
- Impact of relationship types on:
  - Data deletion
  - Record migration
  - Data integrity

### Performance
- Relationship query optimization
- Roll-up summary impact
- Cross-object reporting considerations

## Best Practices

### Relationship Selection
1. Choose appropriate relationship types:
   - Master-Detail for tight coupling
   - Lookup for flexible relationships
   - Junction objects for many-to-many

### Implementation
1. Data Model Planning:
   - Consider future scalability
   - Plan for data volume
   - Account for reporting needs

2. Security Configuration:
   - Set appropriate sharing rules
   - Configure field-level security
   - Manage record access

3. Maintenance:
   - Regular relationship audits
   - Data cleanup procedures
   - Performance monitoring
